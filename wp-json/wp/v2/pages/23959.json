You understand and agree that Potential Customers must link using Your Tracking link for You to receive Affiliate Fees upon them becoming Customers. In no event, We shall be liable for Your failure to use Tracking links and for any Affiliate Fees miscalculation or other damage which may result from such failure. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, We may at any time and Our sole discretion amend Our tracking system and reporting format and provide You notice to that effect.<\/p><p>3.11. If You disagree with the monthly reports or the amount payable, You might wish to not accept payment for such an amount and should immediately send Us a reasonable objection in writing. Objections must be received within 10 calendar days of Our making available Your monthly report, or Your right to dispute such report or payment will be deemed waived, and You shall have no claims with such regard. Further, Your acceptance of payment transfer or acceptance of other payments from Us will be deemed complete, and the final settlement of Affiliate Fees due for the month is indicated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any overpayment is made by mistake or in the calculation of Your Affiliate Fees We reserve the right to correct such calculation at any time and to reclaim from You any overpayment made and\/or deduct and\/or withhold from You Affiliate Fees.<br \/>3.12. You shall comply at all times with all applicable laws and any policy notified by Us through the Website or otherwise concerning money laundering and\/or the proceeds of crime.<br \/>3.13. All taxes due in connection with any payments to You are Your sole liability. You are solely responsible for complying with the rules, if any, for registering for and paying direct and indirect taxes, including, but not limited to, VAT, levies, duties, income taxes, and other charges in respect of Your income from or concerning this Agreement and for collecting and paying the income tax and social security contributions in respect of Yourself and Your staff, if You have any staff. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that We will not increase the fees payable as Affiliate Fees due to any tax, levy, duty, or charge (including, but not limited to, VAT) imposed on the payment of the Affiliate Fees, and all Affiliate Fees are inclusive of any such tax, charge, duty and\/or levy (including, but not limited to, VAT).<br \/>3.14. To potentially qualify and be approved as a Master Affiliate, You Affiliate must first obtain confirmation from Us in writing whether such right is granted to You, and then confirm the Sub Affiliate Remuneration Plan You would be under and once the sub-affiliate tracking links have been provided to You to further provide Us with the proof of the introduction between Us and the Sub Affiliate. The moment the Sub Affiliate ownership changes, a Master Affiliate will have 30 days to provide the said introduction with the new Sub Affiliate of the Account. Should such an introduction not be provided within these 30 days, We shall terminate the Master Affiliate deal. Furthermore, Master Affiliates will not be entitled to a commission from Affiliates that are already receiving a flat fee.<br \/>3.15. In cases of suspected affiliate fraud, We reserve the right to request identification documents and any other documentation which in our sole discretion we consider necessary.<\/p><p>\u200d<\/p><p><strong>4. HIGH ROLLER POLICY<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>4.1. Negative net revenue generated in any given month by any Customer whom We, in Our sole discretion, deem to be &#8220;high roller&#8221; shall be carried forward and offset against any possible future net revenue generated by the players referred by You until such negative net revenue is zeroed. The criteria for categorizing a player as a &#8220;high roller&#8221; shall be determined at Our sole discretion, and Our sole responsibility in this respect is to notify You of the categorization of any players referred by You as the same by amending this Agreement. The criteria set for determining Our High Roller Policy are:<br \/>4.1.1. if in any given month a player generates a negative net revenue of at least -10,000, and the aggregate net revenue (net revenue) in that month for that affiliate is negative -2,000 or greater, then such player shall be deemed to be a high roller;<br \/>4.1.2. If the two criteria above are met, then the negative net revenue generated by the high roller will be carried forward and offset against future net revenue generated by that high roller;<br \/>4.1.3. The negative balance carried forward cannot be set-off against other players&#8217; net revenue;<br \/>4.1.4. The negative balance carried forward cannot be greater than the total aggregate negative net revenue for the affiliate, for that month;<br \/>4.1.5. If there is more than one high roller, the negative balance carried forward will be split proportionally between them;<br \/>4.1.6. the negative balance of a high roller will be reduced by future positive commissionable revenue that they generate in subsequent months;<br \/>4.1.7. The negative balance of a high roller shall be reduced by the future positive net win that they generate in subsequent months. High Roller\u2019s negative balance will not be increased by future negative net win unless the high roller meets the qualifying criteria in subsequent months.<\/p><p>\u200d<\/p><p><strong>5.
